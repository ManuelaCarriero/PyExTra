The number of messenger RNAs (mRNAs) and proteins can be described by a chemical master equation. The rate of protein production depends on the number of mRNAs but not vice-versa (**m** and **n** are the numbers of mRNA and proteins respectively; **Î¦** is the degraded molecule).

**Gillespie algorithm** (i.e. **stochastic simulation algorithm**) samples the probability distribution described by the master equation. The basic idea is that events are rare, discrete, separate events, i.e., each event is an arrivial of a Poisson process. In this case, each **event** is a change of **state** that move either the copy number of mRNA or protein up or down by 1 in this case. Gillepsie algorithm starts with some **initial states** (**m<sub>0</sub>** and **p<sub>0</sub>**).
